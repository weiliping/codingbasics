# Example 1: Front End Engineer at Facebook

"Hi I’m Yangshun and I graduated from National University of Singapore in 2015 with a degree in Computer Science. 
My interests are in Front End Engineering and I love to create beautiful performant products with delightful user experiences.

Back in school, I designed and built a web application, NUSMods which solves a huge problem of class and timetable planning every semester. 
It receives over a million pageviews a month and is used by over 40,000 NUS students and even some professors. 
It is built using a modern web technology stack - React, Redux, Jest, Babel, Flow, webpack and is mobile-responsive."

I'm interested in the Front End Engineer role at Facebook because I have been using Facebook Open Source Front End technologies 
for a while now and am inspired by Facebook's mission and Open Source culture.

# Example 2: Front End Engineer at Lyft
"Hi I’m Yangshun and I graduated from National University of Singapore in 2015 with a degree in Computer Science. 
My interests are in Front End Engineering and I love to create beautiful performant products with delightful user experiences.

I previously worked at Grab where I led the Grab for Work project. 
Grab for Work was a service for companies to make corporate transportation expenses convenient. 
Companies can create employee groups, set ride policies and share corporate payment methods with their employees. 
I built the project with another engineer over the period of 3 months on a React/Redux and Golang stack."

I'm interested in the Front End Engineer role at Lyft because I like working in this ridesharing space and creating products for users to improve their life.

1. Well, I’ve been working on mobile app development for four years now, while still studying at college. 
Had my own projects, coded mostly in Java and Python, but my account on the play store got suspended, for reasons I still fail to understand. 
But I learned a lot, both at school and while working on the apps. 
Now I am looking to get a job with an innovative game studio, and am glad to be interviewing with you here. 
Apart from coding, I enjoy reading a good book, or a nice evening out with friends. 
That would do for a short introduction, please tell me if you’d like me to elaborate on anything from my education, or experience with apps.
2. My name’s Ron, I’m 34, have worked as a software engineer for a smaller company, in an agile team, 
working mostly on online maps, with Java and C++. 
But just like many other startups this one eventually hasn’t taken of, 
and now I find myself unemployed. 
I prefer to work in a smaller team, and see the direct impact I have on a project, which is the reason no. 1 why I am applying for the job with you. 
Other than that I am more or less an ordinary guy, with a girlfriend and a dog, and a passion for model trains. 
Is there anything else you’d like to know about my life at the moment?
3. My name is Khatia, 22, still a student, looking for a part time job I can do while still at school, ideally working remotely. I’m skilled with PHP and Java, and I am trying to learn other programming languages, step by step. Have two brothers, both of them study at a med school, so it is quite funny that I, as a girl, decided for software engineering. I try to get the most out of my time at the college, and have some edge once I graduate, which is the primary reason why I seek a part time job with you.
4. Jason here, 41, experienced programmer with several successful projects under my belt. 
I’d say my portfolio introduces me better than my words do, so if want we can look at it together, 
and I can tell you about the principal projects I engineered over the years. 
I am a lucky father of two and quite a family man, trying to find a good life-work balance. 
It is one of the reasons why I sit here with you today, because the expectations of the managers in my last job were extreme–they wanted me to work for 70+ hours each week, which is something I could not accept, having a family and life outside of work.
5. My name’s Nicole, I’ve been working in one of the BIG 4 companies for seven years, climbing the career ladder, learning the ins and outs of programming. I still feel young though, and I got tired of working on the same tasks and application month after month, which is often the case in big corporations. Didn’t feel I was growing professionally, and I am looking for a radical change in my career. 
I hope to find what I am looking for in your startup, and I am ready to bring onboard everything I’ve learned in the big corp.
6. I would introduce myself in seven words. Passionate coder, responsible father, best colleague ever. 
That pretty much sums it up, though at least the last one my former colleagues have to confirm. 
I try to do a good job in all roles I have in life, and I enjoy the process immensely.
 Do you want me to talk about my coding skills and experience now, or will we discuss it later in the interview?
7. I’d introduce myself as a dreamer. I dream of working at Google, working on applications billions of people use, having an impact on the world with my work. Sure enough, 
I know you receive hundreds of job applications for every single job opening, 
and I am not the only dreamer waiting for his chance. 
But I will try to convince you in this meeting that I am the one who deserves a chance to prove his skills in the job…

8. I have just over a year of experience as a junior software engineer with First Technology. 
In my short time there, I've already contributed to over a dozen projects and assisted with managing one project for one of 
the firm's long-time clients.
   
9. Prior to this role, I completed a two-year internship with Mobile First, 
where I honed my mobile app development skills. Ideally, 
I would like to continue to specialize in mobile software engineering, an area where I know your firm excels.

10. I've worked in software engineering for my entire 15-year career, 
and my commitment to critical thinking and attention to detail have gotten me to where I am today: 
a senior software engineer for First Technology. I have a passion for processes, 
and I'm an experienced team leader who typically manages 10 developers at any given time.
    
11. Prior to my senior role, I worked as a software engineer for First Technology and a programmer for Mobile First. 
Because I've already held all the other positions in this field, I have keen insight into what it takes to run a successful project. 
My career goal is to move into management as a CTO, and I know this role would help me hone my leadership skills.

12. I have always been a natural leader. With over 10 years of experience in finance and sales, 
    I have been able to exceed my KPIs every quarter and have been promoted twice over the last five years.
    
13. I look back at those successes and I know I wouldn't have been able to achieve them 
if I hadn't built and led a team composed of highly skilled and diverse individuals.
    
    
 A previous employer tasked me with creating an internal online learning and training program for employees. 
 The purpose of the program was to make sure all employees received proper training on certain topics, including customer service, compliance with legal requirements and workplace ethics. 
 I began by researching other similar training systems to figure out what worked and what didn't.
  Next, I used Java to code a simple program, which I then used to upload training courses.
 
 After testing the simplified program, I added elements to make it more engaging to employees, such as games and interactive quizzes. This program was well-received by the employees of the organization, and their customer service success rates increased by 25% after all team members took the required course.
 
 Over the years I have been able to sharpen my leadership skills by conducting 360 reviews, and holding candid feedback sessions for my team.
 I know that working on my leadership skills is something really important to me, and it's really something that
 I'm looking forward to in my next role.
 
 I am proficient in Java, C++, JavaScript, C#, Ruby and Python. Of these programming languages, I feel most comfortable working with Java, C# and C++. In my previous role, I worked mainly with Java to create applications that worked across multiple platforms. I also used C++ to develop a new operating system that worked with the applications I engineered. Using C#, I was able to improve my productivity when developing web-based apps and software.”

 There was a project where we were tasked with reworking the browser client application. It used an imperative, object-oriented approach with many of the custom controls getting much of their functionality from a growing inheritance hierarchy. We took this as an opportunity to shift to a more declarative approach. After the conversion, we saw a dramatic decline in state-related bugs as we were no longer manually updating the interface in response to events. This had previously been the most common type of user-reported bug.
