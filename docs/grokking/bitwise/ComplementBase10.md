# 476. Number Complement - Easy
Given a <b>positive</b> integer ```num```, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

##### Example 1:

```
Input: num = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
```

##### Example 2:

```
Input: num = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
```

##### Constraints:

- The given integer num is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
- ```num >= 1```
- You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
- This question is the same as 1009: https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/

#### Java Solution
```java
public class NumberComplement {

    public static int findComplement(int num) {
        int bit_count = 1, n = num;
        while (n > 0) {
            bit_count = bit_count << 1;
            n = n >> 1;
        }
        bit_count--;
        return num ^ bit_count;
    }
}
```
