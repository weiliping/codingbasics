# 759. Employee Free Time - Hard

We are given a list ```schedule``` of employees, which represents the working time for each employee.
Each employee has a list of non-overlapping Intervals, and these intervals are in sorted order.
Return the list of finite intervals representing common, positive-length free time for all employees, also in sorted order.
##### Example 1:

```
Input: schedule = [[[1,2],[5,6]],[[1,3]],[[4,10]]]
Output: [[3,4]]
Explanation:
There are a total of three employees, and all common
free time intervals would be [-inf, 1], [3, 4], [10, inf].
We discard any intervals that contain inf as they aren't finite.
```
#####  Example 2:
```
Input: schedule = [[[1,3],[6,7]],[[2,4]],[[2,5],[9,12]]]
Output: [[5,6],[7,9]]
```

(Even though we are representing ```Intervals``` in the form ```[x, y]```, the objects inside are ```Intervals```, not lists or arrays. For example, ```schedule[0][0].start = 1, schedule[0][0].end = 2```, and ```schedule[0][0][0]``` is not defined.)

Also, we wouldnâ€™t include intervals like [5, 5] in our answer, as they have zero length.

##### Note:
- ```schedule``` and ```schedule[i]``` are lists with lengths in range ```[1, 50]```.
- 0 <= schedule[i].start < schedule[i].end <= 10<sup>^8</sup>.

#### Java Solution
```java
public class EmployeeFreeTime {
    /**
     * #759
     *
     * @param avails
     * @return
     */
    public static List<Interval> employeeFreeTime(List<List<Interval>> avails) {
        List<Interval> result = new ArrayList<>();
        List<Interval> timeLine = new ArrayList<>();
        avails.forEach(e -> timeLine.addAll(e));
        Collections.sort(timeLine, ((a, b) -> a.start - b.start));

        Interval temp = timeLine.get(0);
        for (Interval each : timeLine) {
            if (temp.end < each.start) {
                result.add(new Interval(temp.end, each.start));
                temp = each;
            } else {
                temp = temp.end < each.end ? each : temp;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
